# Biometric Authentication

## Overview
Biometric authentication is a security process that relies on unique biological characteristics of individuals to verify their identity. This project demonstrates the implementation of biometric authentication using various biometric modalities such as fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, and iris recognition.

## Features
- Fingerprint Recognition: Uses fingerprint scanners to authenticate users based on their unique fingerprint patterns.
- Facial Recognition: Utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize and verify users through facial features.

## Way to test:
- To enable feature: Simulator > Features > Face ID > Enrolled
- To test:
  - Simulator > Features > Face ID > Matching Face
  - Simulator > Features > Face ID > Non-matching Face
